# Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

### Paradigm
* Definition: A paradigm is a mental image of the way things are (i.e. subjective truth), a perception, a set of ideas governing a specific field or a frame of reference. Paradigm is formed by individual backgrounds, experiences. All of us think that we see the world as it is, but in fact, we see the world as we are. All we have is assumptions of the way things are. Our paradigms, correct or incorrect are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors.

### Paradigm Shift
* Paradigm shift refers to a transformation in paradigm, a change in perspective. Paradigm shift involves breaking contemporary pardigms and making way for new paradigms.

### Character Ethic VS Personality Ethic

### Habit
* Habit is the intersection of knowledge(theorical paradigm), skill(ability), and desire(motivation). Our character is a composite of our habits. Forming habits requires all three while breking them also requires all of them. Breaking a deeply integrated habit requires tremendous effort.

### Maturity continuum
Maturity is lifelong process starting from infancy to adulthood. Physical maturity does not guarantee emotional or mental maturity. There are three stages of maturity: 
* Dependence
   - The paradigm of You.
   - Dependent people need others to get what they want.
* Independence
   - The paradigm of I.
   - Independent people can get what they want through their own effort.
* Interdependence
   - The paradigm of We.
   - Interdependent people people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve thier greatest successes.
