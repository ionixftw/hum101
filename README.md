# Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

### Paradigm
* Definition: A paradigm is a mental image of the way things are (i.e. subjective truth), a perception, a set of ideas governing a specific field or a frame of reference. Paradigm is formed by individual backgrounds, experiences. All of us think that we see the world as it is, but in fact, we see the world as we are. All we have is assumptions of the way things are. Our paradigms, correct or incorrect are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors.

### Paradigm Shift
* Paradigm shift refers to a transformation in paradigm, a change in perspective. Paradigm shift involves breaking contemporary pardigms and making way for new paradigms.

### Character Ethic VS Personality Ethic

| Character Ethic | Personality Ethic |
| ------ | ------ |
| Focuses on how to "actually be" insted of how to "appear to be" | Focuses on how to "appear to be" rather than how to "actually be" |
| Puts emphasis on integrity, fidelity, compassion, courage, compassion, contribution, responsibility. | Puts emphasis on appearance, public image, social interaction techniques, appearing likable to others. |
| Contributes to effectiveness. | Does not contribute to effectiveness. |
| Character ethic is deeply imbedded qualities. | Personality ethic is manifestation of qualities regardless of actually possessing them or not. |

### Habit

* Habit is the intersection of knowledge(theorical paradigm), skill(ability), and desire(motivation). Our character is a composite of our habits. Forming habits requires all three while breaking them also requires all of them. Breaking a deeply integrated habit requires tremendous effort.

### Maturity continuum
Maturity is a lifelong process of becoming matured starting from infancy to adulthood. Physical maturity does not guarantee emotional or mental maturity. There are three stages of maturity: 
* Dependence
   - The paradigm of You.
   - Dependent people rely on others to get what they want.
* Independence
   - The paradigm of I.
   - Independent people can get what they want through their own effort.
* Interdependence
   - The paradigm of We.
   - Interdependent people people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve thier greatest successes.

# Seven Habits

### Habit #1: Be Proactive (Principles of Personal Vision)

* This habit is based on four unique human endowments: imagination, conscience, independent will and self-awareness.

> **Proactive People:** Proactive people do not blame circumstances, conditions or environment for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice based on values rather than feelings. The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person.

> **Reactive People:** Reactive people blame circumstances, conditions or environment for their behavior. Their behavior is driven by feelings, by environment, by circumstances rather than their own conscious choice.

#### Circle of Influence vs Circle of Concern 

| Circle of Influence | Circle of Concern |
| ---- | ---- | 
| Things over which we have control or we can do something about. | Things over which we have no  real control. |
| Proactive people spend their time and energy in this circle causing their Circle of influence to increase. | Reactive people spend their time and energy in this circle causing their Circle of Concern to increase. |
| The ability to make and keep commitments magnifies our Circle of Influence. | The inability to make and keep commitments magnifies our Circle of Concern. |
| Large Circle of Influence exhibits strength of character. | Large Circle of Concern exhibits weakness of character. |

### Habit #2: Begin with the end in mind (Principle of Personal Leadership)

* This habit is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There's mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation to all things. Our Circle of Influence enlarges if we take the responsibility of two creations equally.

* Begin with the end in mind focuses specifically on the mental creation, the ability to envision, to see the potential, to create with our minds what we cannot at present see without eyes.

* It is also based on principles of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first creation and management is the second one. According to Peter Drucker and  Warren Bennis 
> "Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things."

* Leadership comes before management.

* People or things are subject to frequent and immediate change, but principles are constant. Principles are bigger than people or circumstances and it has been proven time and time again throughout history.

* Principles always have natural consequences attached to them. There are positive consequences when we live in harmony with principles and negative consequences when we ignore them.

* By centering our lives on timeless, unchanging principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of effective living.

### Habit #3: Put first things first (Principles of Personal Management)

* Put first things first focuses on the physical creation or the management. It's the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. It's the actualization, the fulfillment, the natural emergence of the first two habits. 

* After being aware of and developing one's own proactive nature, one needs to be aware of one's paradigm and align them with fundamental principles to form a solid foundation. With that fondation, one can become principle-centered by practicing effective self-management.

* The essential focus of the personal management can be captured in the Time Management Matrix diagram.

#### Time Management Matrix Diagram

| Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important | Quadrant 2: Not Urgent but Important |
| ---- | ---- |
| Q1 deals with crises and problems because they are both urgent and important. Ex: Fire Alarm, Medical emergencies. |  Q2 is the heart of effective personal management. Q2 deals with things that are important but may not seem urgent. Things or activities like this require more initiative, more proactivity and are high-leverage capacity-building. A person should spend more time in this quadrant. Ex: building relationships, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, preparing for exam, long-range planning, writing a personal mission statement. |
| **Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important** | **Quadrant 4: Not Urgent and Not Important** |
| We react to urgent but not important matters that are often based on priorities and expectation of others. Ex: Live football or cricket match, replying to facebook messages | Q4 includes activities of entertainment, relaxation. | 

### Habit #4: Think win-win (Principles of Interpersonal Leadership) 

#### Six Paradigms of Human Interaction

#### Win-Win

* Win-win is the frame of mind that seeks mutual benefits in all human interactions.

* Win-win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying and is based on the abundance principle(that there is plenty for everyone). 

* Win-win sees life as a cooperative arena, not a competitive arena.

#### Win-Lose

* Win-lose is the paradigm of competition, where there is only one winner.

* This type of mentality is fueled by comparison.

#### Lose-Win

* Lose-win is the frame of mind that seeks strength from popularity or acceptance. 

* People who possess this mentality give up easily, are really easy to please and have little courage to express their own feelings and convictions.

* Win-lose people love this type of people because they love their weaknesses.

#### Lose-Lose

* When two win-lose people get together, no one wins. Both of them lose.

#### Win

* Win is the frame of mind that seeks only personal success and does not necessarily require loss of others.

* A person of with the win mentality thinks in terms of securing his own ends and leaving it to others to secure theirs.

#### Win-Win or No Deal

* If there is no mutual benefit, then there is no agreement.

* Only when both parties become satisfied, then the deal goes on. Otherwise, there is no deal and no harsh feelings towards each other. This way both parties get the opportunity to be honest with each other and understand each others perspective.

### Habit #5 Seek First to Understand, Then To Be Understood (Principles of Empathic Communication)

* The essence of empathic listening is not just agreeing with someone, but fully, deeply understanding the person, emotionally as well as intellectually.

* Empathic listening involves seeing the world through the perspective of the speaker and trying to understand the speaker's thoughts and beliefs instead of listening with intent to reply.

* Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood. Knowing how to be understood is the second part of habit 5. After understanding the speaker through empathic listening, then comes the right time to provide feedback, opinion, or advice. Seeking to be understood requires courage.

### Habit #6 Synergize (Principles of creative cooperation) 

* Synergy is the essence of principle-centered Leadership. It means that the whole part is greater than the sum of its parts. It means the relationship which the parts have to each other is a part in and of itself. It is the most catalytic, the most empowering, he most unifying, and the most exciting part.

* In other words, Synergy is the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.

* Valuing the differences is the essence of synergy -- the mental, the emotional, the psychological differences between people.

* The key to valuing those differences is to realize that all people see the world, not as it is, but as they are.

* Synergy is also based on the principle that none of us is as smart as all of us and working with cooperation of others unleashes the greatest power within people.

#### Habit #7 Sharpen the Saw (Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal)

* This habit surrounds all the other habits because it is the habit that makes all the other possible. It means exercising all four dimensions of our nature, regularly and consistently in wise and balanced ways.

#### Four Dimesions of Renewal

##### Physical

* The physical dimesion involves caring effectively for our physical body by eating the right kind of foods, getting sufficient rest and relaxation and exercising on a regular basis.

* Exercise, Nutrition, Stress Management

* Related to Habit #1.

* Exercising is a Q1 activity.


##### Spiritual

* The spiritual dimension is a one's core, one's center, one's commitment to own values. It's a very private area of life that draws upon the sources which inspire and uplift a person.

* Value Clarification and commitment, Study and motivation.

* Related to Habit #2.

* Spiritual renewal is a Q2 activity.

##### Mental

* Reading, Visualizing, Planning, Writing

* Related to Habit #3.

##### Social/Emotional

* Service, Empathy, Synergy, Intrinsic Security

* Focuses on Habit #4, #5, #6

* Social and emotional dimension of our lives are tied together because our emotional life is primarily, but not exclusively, developed out of and manifested in our relationships with others.

* Renewing social/emotional dimension requires exercise.

#### Balance in Renewal
* The self-renwal process must include balanced renewal in all four dimensions of our nature: the physical, the spiritual, the mental, and the social/emotional.

* To neglect any one are negatively impacts the rest.

# Basics of Ethic and Culture

### Mortality 
> **Definition:** Morality is a system of guidance designed to assist us in the living of our lives.

* Morality requires self sacrifice and the curbing of our inclination to want and to do anything that pleases us.

* The primary goal of morality is to estbalish appropriate constraints of human behavior because we do not live together peacefully. 

### Ethics 

> **Definition:** Ethics is the study of morality and moral behavior. Ethics is the philosphical discipline dealing with our moral choices, actions, judgements, and their rational justifications.

* **Moral Dilemma:** Moral dilemma occurs when desirable and undesirable alternatives conflict. 

### Fundamental characteristics of Moral Behavior

1. **Harm:** Harm is the experience of pain, suffering, or deprivation against our will that results from the willful or negligent act of another person. No one wants to be harmed. But the coexisting realities - the universal aversion to harm and the universal human tenedency to inflict harm - are the conditions that make morality **necessary**.

2. **Mutual Aid:** Assisting others in their lives by contributing to their well-being or benefit.

### Two dimensions of morality

* Individual (assumes the individual as a moral agent)

* Social (moral institutuion of life)

* Morality is a social enterprise that involves a system of rules, ideals, and sanctions, and thereby serves the essential social functions of harmony and cooperation.

* Since morality has a social dimension, it applies to institutions, institutional arrangements and policies.

* The study of ethics focuses on behavior rather that motives, itention, or character. Because the actions that people take either causes harm or prevents it. Many intentions are never acted on whether each moral action may count as either harm or help.

* Ethics also deals with the concept of rational justification. Work in the field of ethics is based ultimately on reason and its power to justify beliefs.

* To justify a belief is to give sufficient grounds for it, or backings to it. There are various kinds of backings - in **religion**, and in **reason** for a warranted moral belief.

* Our understanding may be further clarified by distinguishing morality or moral behavior from law, etiquette, customary morality, and religion.

| Ethics and ..... | Definition |
| ---- | ----- |
| Law | Law reflects various moral rules, ideals, and sanctions of a society but it can not cover all acts or intentions, nor it prescribe for all acts of mutual aid. Law occasionally runs contraty to morality - is unjust - and hence, may be justifiably be disobeyed in exceptional cases. |
| Etiquette | Etiquette refers to the acceptable forms of behavior that are associated with social and official life. Ex: proper language, appropriate eating habits. Negative etiquettes convey judgements about manners or taste, not ethics. |
| *Customary morality* and **religion** | Customary morality and religion both propose action-guides and appropriate sanctions in the interest of a better life in the *community* or within the **religion**. The problem with both is that they may prescribe actions in the name of *custom* or **deity** that violate fundamental morality. Ex: *Customary morality* in various societies has condoned and even advocated slavery, systematic discrimination. Ex: **Religion** also sometimes require their followers to engage in practices that seemingly inflict gratuitous harm on others ( as in holy wars, human sacrifices, and deprivation of possessions).

### The two main groups of theories of moral philosoply

| Teleological (consequentialism) | Deontological (non-consequentialism) |
| ---- | ---- |
| Stresses on consequences. | Stresses on the nature of actions. |
| Right or wrong action, and judgement about these, are determined by the results produced. | Right or wrong action are based upon certain features of the act itself, not necessarily the results produced by the act. |
| Ex: Exercising, Dieting. | Ex: Promise keeping, telling the truth, respecting the right of others. |


* Though philosophical ethics and religiously based ethics are distinct, ethical reflection is heavily based on religious teachings.

* Religious or natural ethics should be treated by their contribution in prevention in human harm and in maximizing human benefit.
