# Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

### Paradigm
* Definition: A paradigm is a mental image of the way things are (i.e. subjective truth), a perception, a set of ideas governing a specific field or a frame of reference. Paradigm is formed by individual backgrounds, experiences. All of us think that we see the world as it is, but in fact, we see the world as we are. All we have is assumptions of the way things are. Our paradigms, correct or incorrect are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors.

### Paradigm Shift
* Paradigm shift refers to a transformation in paradigm, a change in perspective. Paradigm shift involves breaking contemporary pardigms and making way for new paradigms.

### Character Ethic VS Personality Ethic

| Character Ethic | Personality Ethic |
| ------ | ------ |
| Focuses on how to "actually be" insted of how to "appear to be" | Focuses on how to "appear to be" rather than how to "actually be" |
| Puts emphasis on integrity, fidelity, compassion, courage, compassion, contribution, responsibility. | Puts emphasis on appearance, public image, social interaction techniques, appearing likable to others. |
| Contributes to effectiveness. | Does not contribute to effectiveness. |
| Character ethic is deeply imbedded qualities. | Personality ethic is manifestation of qualities regardless of actually possessing them or not. |

### Habit

* Habit is the intersection of knowledge(theorical paradigm), skill(ability), and desire(motivation). Our character is a composite of our habits. Forming habits requires all three while breking them also requires all of them. Breaking a deeply integrated habit requires tremendous effort.

### Maturity continuum
Maturity is lifelong process starting from infancy to adulthood. Physical maturity does not guarantee emotional or mental maturity. There are three stages of maturity: 
* Dependence
   - The paradigm of You.
   - Dependent people rely on others to get what they want.
* Independence
   - The paradigm of I.
   - Independent people can get what they want through their own effort.
* Interdependence
   - The paradigm of We.
   - Interdependent people people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve thier greatest successes.

# Seven Habits

### Habit #1: Be Proactive (Principles of Personal Vision)

* This habit is based on four unique human endowments: imagination, conscience, independent will and self-awareness.

> **Proactive People:** Proactive people do not blame circumstances, conditions or environment for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice based on values rather than feelings. The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person.

> **Reactive People:** Reactive people blame circumstances, conditions or environment for their behavior. Their behavior is driven by feelings, by environment, by circumstances rather than their own conscious choice.

#### Circle of Influence vs Circle of Concern 

| Circle of Influence | Circle of Concern |
| ---- | ---- | 
| Things over which we have control or we can do something about. | Things over which we have no  real control. |
| Proactive people spend their time and energy in this circle causing their Circle of influence to increase. | Reactive people spend their time and energy in this circle causing their Circle of Concern to increase. |
| The ability to make and keep commitments magnifies our Circle of Influence. | The inability to make and keep commitments magnifies our Circle of Concern. |
| Large Circle of Influence exhibits strength of character. | Large Circle of Concern exhibits weakness of character. |

### Habit #2: Begin with the end in mind (Principle of Personal Leadership)

* This habit is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There's mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation to all things. Our Circle of Influence enlarges if we take the responsibility of two creations equally.

* Begin with the end in mind focuses specifically on the mental creation, the ability to envision, to see the potential, to create with our minds what we cannot at present see without eyes.

* It is also based on principles of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first creation and management is the second one. According to Peter Drucker and  Warren Bennis 
> "Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things."

* Leadership comes before management.

* People or things are subject to frequent and immediate change, but principles are constant. Principles are bigger than people or circumstances and it has been proven time and time again throughout history.

* Principles always have natural consequences attached to them. There are positive consequences when we live in harmony with principles and negative consequences when we ignore them.

* By centering our lives on timeless, unchanging principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of effective living.

### Habit #3: Put first things first (Principles of Personal Management)

* Put first things first focuses on the physical creation or the management. It's the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. It's the actualization, the fulfillment, the natural emergence of the first two habits. 

* After being aware of and developing one's own proactive nature, one needs to be aware of one's paradigm and align them with fundamental principles to form a solid foundation. With that fondation, one can become principle-centered by practicing effective self-management.

* The essential focus of the personal management can be captured in the Time Management Matrix diagram.

#### Time Management Matrix Diagram

| Quadrant 1: Urgent and Important | Quadrant 2: Not Urgent but Important |
| ---- | ---- |
| Q1 deals with crises and problems because they are both urgent and important. Ex: Fire Alarm, Medical emergencies. |  Q2 is the heart of effective personal management. Q2 deals with things that are important but may not seem urgent. Things or activities like this require more initiative, more proactivity and are high-leverage capacity-building. A person should spend more time in this quadrant. Ex: building relationships, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, preparing for exam, long-range planning, writing a personal mission statement. |
| **Quadrant 3: Urgent but Not Important** | **Quadrant 4: Not Urgent and Not Important** |
| We react to urgent but not important matters that are often based on priorities and expectation of others. Ex: Live football or cricket match, replying to facebook messages | Q4 includes activities of entertainment, relaxation. |
